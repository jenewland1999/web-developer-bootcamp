    <h1>JavaScript Basics: Control Flow</h1>
    <p>In this document we will look at loops. The first loop is the <strong>while</strong> loop. This loop takes a condition and runs until the condition is met. We also look at <strong>Do While</strong> loops. These are almost identical to <strong>While</strong> loops, but have one key difference. The <strong>Do While</strong> loop runs at least once before checking the condition - which is represented in the code as the condition is placed at the end of the statement as shown below.</p>
    <script type="text/javascript">
      
      console.log("1. Print all numbers between -10 and 19");

      var num = -10;

      while (num <= 19) {
        console.log(num);
        num++;
      }

      console.log("2. Print all even numbers between 10 and 40");

      var num2 = 10;

      while (num2 <= 40) {
        if (num2 % 2 === 0) {
          console.log(num2);
        }
        num2++;
      }

      console.log("3. Print all odd numbers between 300 and 333");

      var num3 = 300;

      while (num3 <= 333) {
        if (num3 % 2 !== 0) {
          console.log(num3);
        }
        num3++;
      }

      console.log("4. Print all numbers divisible by 3 AND 5 between 5 and 50");

      var num4 = 5;

      while (num4 <= 50) {
        if ((num4 % 3 === 0) && (num4 % 5 === 0)) {
          console.log(num4);
        }
        num4++;
      }
    
      // This is an example of a do while loop. As you can see the condition is already false, but if you run the code in the console you'll see that it will still run once. 
      var x = 10;

      do {
        console.log("The value for \"x\" is " + x);
      } while (x < 10)
