    /* When I attempted this challenge I did the following - My attempt could've been improved by first converting the input to a number so that I wouldn't have to type check and number check it. Furthermore, I had nested if statements which was incorrect as I wasn't checking for multiple conditions only each of them separately and because of this it caused issues with ordering it. Finally, I failed to remember to comment my code which is bad practice as always. */
