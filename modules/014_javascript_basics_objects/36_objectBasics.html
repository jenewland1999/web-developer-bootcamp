  <h1>JavaScript Basics: Objects</h1>
  <p>In this document, we'll cover Objects. This is the most advanced data structure in JavaScript. The object is created by using curly braces, inside of which contains key value pairs "key: value". Objects can include any other data type or data structure including themselves and are also able to function outside of JavaScript using the derived syntax of JSON (JavaScript Object Notation).</p>

  <script type="text/javascript">
  
    // An example object
    var person = {
      name: "John",
      age: 20,
      city: "Plymouth"
    }

    // Defining an object
    var object = new Object();
    var objectAlt = {};

    // Retrieving information from an object
    // + Use variables e.g. var x = "name"; console.log(person[x]);
    console.log(person["name"]);

    // - This method doesn't work for property names that have spaces or begin with a number
    console.log(person.name);
  
  </script>
